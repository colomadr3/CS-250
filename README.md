How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
It is important to be cognizant of the users' needs as you develop a program. A program that is user-friendly and works as expected will ensure that the user will not only be happy with the product but also keep them from doing things with the program that were not expected as a developer. Focus groups are a great means of gathering information for planning. QA testing is good for once you have working code to gain feedback and ensure you are meeting the users' expectations. User stories are essentially the goals you are trying to achieve with your program. They are a good way to determine value in the work you do and estimate progress and deadlines. As a developer, you want to make sure that the program meets the needs of the user. 
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
As I go through my classes, my process and outlook evolve. Coming from this class, I now think about the end user first and try to plan things out based on what I think they are expecting out of my program. UML and Software Design Docs are also at the start of my development process. I hope to incorporate communication with the client/end users in future projects. Often I can get in my own head and end up focusing on unnecessary details. It would be good to collaborate with the people I am developing the software for.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Scrum is all about being a good team member. Ensuring you are working together and pulling your weight so that everyone can succeed together. Good team members take ownership of their work and instill quality throughout. They communicate and work to resolve issues together. They are considerate of their colleagues and compassionate to their efforts. Good team members strive to meet the goals of the team.
